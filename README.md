# React Design System with Storybook

## Overview

This project is a design system created using React and Storybook. It was developed as part of a comprehensive tutorial from [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/introduction/), focusing on best practices for building scalable and robust UI components. The design system includes a variety of foundational and complex components that can be reused throughout projects.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this tutorial, I have learned:
- **Setting up Storybook**: How to configure Storybook in a React application.
- **Developing Components**: Best practices for developing isolated and reusable components.
- **Interaction Testing**: Techniques for writing interaction tests to ensure components function as expected across different scenarios.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that UI components meet accessibility standards.
- **Documentation**: How to document components effectively using Storybook to provide guidelines and usage information.
- **Deployment**: Deploying Storybook to Chromatic to share with team members and stakeholders.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Storybook
- Chromatic
- Jest for interaction testing
